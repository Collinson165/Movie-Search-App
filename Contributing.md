# Contributing to Movie-Search-App

Thank you for considering contributing to Movie-Search-App! Your contributions help make this project better and more valuable.

Before you start, please take a moment to review the following guidelines. These guidelines will help ensure that your contributions align with our project's goals and standards.

## Getting Started

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository and create a new branch for your contribution.
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
  ```
- Install any necessary dependencies according to the project's documentation.

## Obtaining Secret Keys

Many projects require the use of secret keys for accessing external services. To contribute to [Your Project Name], you might need to obtain your own secret keys and set them up for local development. Here's how:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file in the project's root directory to `.env`:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and replace the placeholders with your own secret keys. These keys might be required to access APIs, databases, or other services used by the project.

3. Keep the `.env` file private and **do not commit it to the repository**. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude it from version control.


## How to Contribute

1. Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/collinson165/movie-search-app/issues) to find a task that interests you or fits your expertise.
2. Comment on the issue to express your interest in working on it.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your contribution:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Write your code, following the project's coding style and best practices.
5. Document your changes when necessary, including comments in code and updates to documentation files.
6. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as intended.
7. Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
   ```
8. Push your branch to your forked repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
9. Open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/opening-a-pull-request) (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository. Be sure to provide a detailed description of your changes in the PR.

## Guidelines
